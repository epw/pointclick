This project will contain the basis for Point-and-Click adventure
games using POVray and HTML image maps.

The simplest possible form of such a game is a "Room Escape," which
will be used as a sample. However, in theory the system should support
a game as complicated as Myst.

Writing a Game
==============

There are two parts to writing a game using this system: Rendering and
logic.

Rendering
---------

Every image which will be shown to the player needs to exist in the
directory. For this documentation, POVray is assumed to have been used
to render the scenes.
